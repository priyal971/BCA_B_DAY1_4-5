 <hr>
<strong>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
 <br>In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</strong>
 Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, 
 <br>Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, 
 but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.

<hr>
<q>As a markup language, the purpose of <abbr title="HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE">HTML</abbr> is to provide a set of general rules that suggest how content should look when rendered.
 A markup language doesn't dictate the methods used to display the content.
,nor does it have foreknowledge of the target context, so this control is imprecise.</q>
